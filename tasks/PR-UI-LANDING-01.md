PR ID: PR-UI-LANDING-01
Title: Homepage and /tests product redesign (Calm Premium)
Branch name: pr/ui-landing-01-home-tests
Goal: Make the public homepage (/) and tests listing (/tests) feel like a finished product, not a dev vitrine. Remove technical/tenant debug copy, replace slug-like labels with human labels, and improve information hierarchy and interactions while staying within the Calm Premium design system (primary ink CTA already implemented by PR-UI-07).
Non-goals: Do not touch the test runner flow, preview/pay/report, admin UI, or analytics logic. Do not introduce Tailwind Plus. Do not add new external dependencies.
Context: Current home page builds explorerSubheading as "Tenant homepage for {tenantLabel} ({locale}). ..." and surfaces internal labels like "Tenant homepage". Categories are derived from test.category which today is often a slug like "daily-habits" and is shown as-is. /tests currently exposes technical copy "Search with ?q=" and uses query params without a proper search UI.
Implementation tasks:
1) Homepage copy cleanup in apps/web/src/app/page.tsx: remove homepageLabel, remove explorerSubheading concatenation, and pass a clean subheading to TenantTestExplorer. Required behavior: hero headline should be homepageCopy.headline when set, otherwise "Discover your next self-assessment"; hero subheadline should be homepageCopy.subheadline when set (trimmed), otherwise "Browse the available tests and start when you're ready.". Do not include tenantLabel, domain, or locale in the user-facing subheading.
2) Human category labels in apps/web/src/lib/hub/categories.ts: add a small helper that converts slug-like categories to a human label. Rule: if a category value contains '-' or '_' and looks like a slug (lowercase letters/numbers and separators), show it as Title Case words with spaces (example: daily-habits -> Daily habits). Keep category_slug stable by using the existing toCategorySlug. Ensure deriveTenantCategories returns labels in human form.
3) TenantTestExplorer UI polish in apps/web/src/components/public/TenantTestExplorer.tsx: (a) When tests.length <= 1, remove the 3 large metric cards (Available tests, Categories, Average length) and replace with a single compact stats row under the search area (for example: "1 test" and "~5 min"), or hide metrics entirely; do not waste vertical space. (b) Category chips: keep the current behavior, but render the count as a small Badge or separated span with proper spacing so it does not look like "daily-habits 1" stuck together. (c) Test cards: make the entire card clickable (clicking anywhere opens /t/{slug}), while keeping the primary CTA button visible. Implement this via an absolute Link overlay with proper z-index so the button remains clickable and accessible. Keep existing shadows/borders consistent with Calm Premium.
4) /tests page redesign in apps/web/src/app/tests/page.tsx: replace the technical hint "Search with ?q=" with a real search UI. Implement a GET form with an Input named "q" that submits to /tests, preserving current server filtering logic. Add a "Clear" action that links to /tests (no query). Keep the count line, but rewrite it to product copy (no mention of query params). Keep the card grid, but match the same card style used on homepage (shadows, borders, badges). Do not convert this page to a client-only page.
5) Visual regression workflow: after UI changes, update the Playwright visual baselines created by PR-UI-GATE-01. Run pnpm --filter @quiz-factory/web e2e:visual -- --update-snapshots and commit the updated snapshots. Ensure the diff is expected and limited to the homepage and /tests screenshots (and any dependent navigation elements), not unrelated pages.
Quality gate before commit: pnpm --filter @quiz-factory/web lint, pnpm --filter @quiz-factory/web typecheck, pnpm --filter @quiz-factory/web e2e:visual, and the existing smoke test.
Commit message: PR-UI-LANDING-01: Homepage and tests product redesign
Success criteria: (a) Homepage no longer shows "Tenant homepage" or "... for {domain} ({locale})"; it reads like a product landing. (b) Category labels are human readable (Daily habits), not raw slugs. (c) Homepage metrics do not waste space when there is only 1 test. (d) /tests has a real search input and no technical copy about "?q=". (e) Playwright visual regression tests pass with updated snapshots committed in the PR.
