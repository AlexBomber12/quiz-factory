Content sources
===============

Each test keeps human authored Markdown sources in a dedicated folder. This is
required because Codex cannot accept file attachments.

Rules
-----
- For each test_id, create content/sources/<test_id>/
- Add these locale files:
  - source.en.md
  - source.es.md
  - source.pt-BR.md
- Keep secrets and PII out of these files.
