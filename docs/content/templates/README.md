Templates
=========

Purpose
-------
This folder holds human authored templates for new tests. Authors can use them as a
starting point before creating localized source files. LLMs can use them to
follow the required structure and avoid missing fields.

Usage
-----
- Pick the template that matches the intended test format.
- Fill in every placeholder and keep IDs stable.
- Copy the resulting content into content/sources/<test_id>/source.<locale>.md
  before running the content add pipeline.
