# Calm Premium Variant Selection

Selected Tenant Homepage variant: `tenant-home-b.png`
Selected Test Landing variant: `test-landing-a.png`

## Why these variants
- Tenant home B keeps search and category chips above the fold while preserving one clear primary CTA.
- Tenant home B balances discovery and trust with a compact KPI panel that does not compete with navigation.
- Test landing A follows the target conversion sequence in one scroll: hero, what you get, trust, FAQ, sticky CTA.
- Test landing A cleanly separates primary and secondary actions so the teal CTA stays singular per section.
